# Simple PONG game using HTML and JavaScript

This is a simple PONG game using HTML and JavaScript. The game is played by two players, each controlling a paddle. 

The objective is to hit the ball with your paddle and score points by making the ball pass the opponent's paddle.

The idea with this project is just to train and improve my skills with HTML and JavaScript and also to have some fun.

I added some effects to the game, like throwing sparks when the ball hits the walls and text effects when the ball scores a point.

I kept the game simple and clean and all in one file, so it's easy to understand and modify.

I hope you enjoy it! ðŸ˜‰
